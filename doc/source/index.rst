.. _label-analytical-scattering:

Analytical scattering
+++++++++++++++++++++

This small templatized class aims at providing functions for the analytical validition of scattering problems. It is related to the `castor <http://leprojetcastor.gitlab.labos.polytechnique.fr/castor>`_ project, but not part of. The template ``<T>`` (see :ref:`label-class-analyticalscattering`) can be either ``float`` or ``double`` and the return type will be a ``matrix<std::complex<T>>``.
