# AnalyticalScattering

Welcome to the main page of the [castor-related](http://leprojetcastor.gitlab.labos.polytechnique.fr/castor/) **AnalyticalScattering** project. 
The documentation can be found [here](https://marcbakry.github.io/AnalyticalScattering/). Analytical scattering aims at providing tools for the
analytical computation of propagating waves for multiple physics. Since this is work in progress, only acoustic waves are currently implemented.
